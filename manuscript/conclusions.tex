\section{Discussion and conclusion}
%%% Final considerations here
We show in this work that the computational cost of the equivalent layer can vary from up to $10^9$ flops depending on the method without compromising the linear system stability. The convolutional method has the necessity of using a regular grid, a problem that can be easily overcome with a gridding or interpolation method. The deconvolution is one of the fastest method but, has two drawbacks besides the regular grid, the necessity of choosing the correct parameter of stabilization and also a higher residual and border effects after processing, that can be seen from the upward continuation of the real data from Caraj√°s. The authors advise cautionary use of the latter method despite the computational cost reduction.
