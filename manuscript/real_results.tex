\section{Real data application}
\label{sec:real_data}

Gridded data of 1000x500 (500000 observed points) for both grav and mag. Data is at -900m.

Grav equivalent layer depth is 300 m and 50 iterations of the cgls method was used.
Mag equivalent layer depth is 0 m and 200 iterations of the cgls method was used.

On an Intel Core i7 7700HQ@2.8 GHz processor in single processing and single-threading modes
the gravimetric equivalent layer took $9.19$ seconds to estimate the equivalent sources with the convolutional method and $0.51$ seconds with the deconvolutional method. 

The magnetic equivalent layer took $82$ seconds to estimate the equivalent sources with the convolutional method and $0.84$ seconds with the deconvolutional method.

As Caraj√°s area is very large different values of the magnetic main field can be considered. 
The main field declination was calculated using the tool in the website (for the date 01/01/2014): https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/calculators/magcalc.shtml
For this application I considered an approximated mid location of the area (latitude $-6.55^{\circ}$ and longitude $-50.75^{\circ})$. The declination is $-19.865^{\circ}$ and the inclination $-7.43915^{\circ}$.
As the source magnetization is unknown inclination and declination equal to the main field is being used for all the equivalent sources.
